# Origin
This is a fork of a very useful project found here https://github.com/ianhi/AC295-final-project-JWI/. Go check it out!

# Purpose
This is a jupyter notebook widget meant to integrate into a DataJoint pipeline for manual segmentation. It has been altered to take grayscale numpy array images as input, along with an argument of a previous segmentation array. The output is a list of numpy arrays, each containing a different manually segmented mask.
